# Instructions

This are the instructions I followed for creating the API. The API was made in a MacBook, so the commands for the terminal are different from Windows.

## IDE

The API was made in Visual Studio Code, so you need to have it installed. VSCode was used for comfort, because of being more visual when having folders opened and making changes with them.

## Steps

### 1. Create Folder

Create a folder where the API is going to be (in local). The folder can have any name, but is better not to have blank spaces.
