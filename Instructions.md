# Instructions

This are the instructions I followed for creating the API. The API was made in a MacBook, so the commands for the terminal are different from Windows.

## IDE

The API was made in Visual Studio Code, so you need to have it installed. VSCode was used for comfort, because of being more visual when having folders opened and making changes with them.

## Steps

### 1. Create Folder

Create a folder where the API is going to be (in local). The folder can have any name, but is better not to have blank spaces.

### 2. Creating env

Open the folder as well as the terminal in VSCode. At the terminal you have to write the following commands:

```
pip list
```
This shows all the libraries installed at that moment there. Search for flask and virtualenv. If they are not there or an update is needed you can write the following commands:
```
pip install flask
pip install virtualenv
````
